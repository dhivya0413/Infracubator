1. run the mongo db with the persistent volume using host path

2. delete and recreate mongodb and see no data loss


Modify mongo-deployment file by mount volume and provide path

kubectl create -f metadata-deployment.yml

Inside minikube ssh

-> cd /metaservicedata    
   ls

-> kubectl exec -it mongos-deployment-644c78d796-x95kl -- sh

#cd /data/db 
#ls


Both the volume has the same files

Though deleted and recreated the deployment and verified that there is no change of persisted data in the path
